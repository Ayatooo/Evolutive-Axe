# Evolutive-Axe 🧪

[![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Langage-Java-orange)](https://symfony.com/)



A minecraft plugin customizable.

You can create 6 axe levels, from 0 to 5 and define these data :

- Display Name

- Lore

- Enchantments

- Enchantments levels

- Experience needed to level up

For each melon block break, the axe gain experience and can evoluate.


### Roadmap 📚

In the next months,I'll try to add some features.

- More levels and an automatic detections of the numbers

- Some effects, like the possibility to gain speed, haste, ...

- Change the blocks which give experience

- (if you have some idea... Ayato__#0069 on discord)
